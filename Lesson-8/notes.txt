There are two types of objects in javascript


1. JSON object 

2. Javascript object 


1. JSON object : are similar to javascript object but differ in syntax and do not store functions 


syntax for json object is :

{
    "name":"value",
    "price":intger,
    "daysleft":8,
    "rating":{
        "stars":4,
        "count":69
    },
}

2. Javascript object : these can store functions as even functions are type of value in javascript and the functions stored in object are known as methods

these can not be stored in json object's 


the  json object is used to transfer data between systems which do not use the same programming language.


const product1= {
    name:"value",
    price:intger,
    daysleft:8,
    "rating":{
        "stars":4,
        "count":69
    },
    greet: function(){
        
    }
}
